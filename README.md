# Digital_safe_system
Implemented a digital safe system using verilog hdl language.
In this lock system, only two digits are used to unlock system. With the help of "0" and "1", the lock will be unlock but with specific pattern. This lock will be unlock with "1001001" code and lock by"1000111". If this pattern will be identified by lock then lock will be become open and output unlock bit will be "1", otherwise lock remain close and unlock bit will be "0".
